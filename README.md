Natural language processing (NLP) is the intersection of computer science, linguistics and machine learning. The field focuses on communication between computers and humans in natural language and NLP is all about making computers understand and generate human language. Applications of NLP techniques include voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, but also things like machine translation and text-filtering.

NLP has heavily benefited from recent advances in machine learning, especially from deep learning techniques. The field is divided into the three parts:

Speech Recognition — The translation of spoken language into text.
Natural Language Understanding — The computer's ability to understand what we say.
Natural Language Generation — The generation of natural language by a computer.
